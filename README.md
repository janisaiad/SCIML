## 📝 Description

This project implements modern neural network architectures for operator modeling and solving partial differential equations (PDEs). It is developed in collaboration with Professors Hadrien Montanelli and Samuel Kokh.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Implement and compare two deep learning architectures for operator modeling:
  - **DeepONet** (Deep Operator Network) - To learn operators between function spaces
  - **FNO** (Fourier Neural Operator) - To leverage spectral analysis in operator modeling

- Apply these architectures to solving partial differential equations (PDEs), with a particular focus on the heat equation

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- **Operator Modeling**: Learning to map functional input spaces to functional output spaces
- **Spectral Analysis**: Using Fourier transforms to efficiently capture spatial dynamics
- **Supervised Learning**: Training on input-output pairs generated by classical numerical solvers

## 📊 Data Format

Training data is structured in triplets (mu, x, sol) where:
- `mu` represents input functions (e.g., boundary conditions, initial conditions)
- `x` represents points in the spatial domain
- `sol` represents expected solutions at points `x`
